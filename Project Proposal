Project Proposal for Nutrify App

1. What tech stack will you use for your final project?
- My app would be a full stack application, including building my own API.

2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
- My app is a full stack application, it includes front-end and back-end. I would be using mongoDB for my API 
and React for this project. It is mostly react and javascript with some CSS.
The images in my project are in the back-end with the routers.

3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
- This is a website and a mobile app, which would allow users to manage their diet wherever they go.

4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
- To help people stay healthy and track what they eat throughout their day. 
The focus is to help people lose weight or gain weight, depending on their goals.

5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
- My users need to be at least 12 years old to use this app. I believe anyone can be 
healthy as soon as they start to have their own body goal.

6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data.
- I used my own data for meal plans, including images, tracking calories, tracking age,
tracking fats, tracking protein, and weight.

● What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially important
if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces notoriously messy data.
- My data was not being sent to mongoDB it was deploying correctly and the data was not being
sent correctly. I had to run a few tests before actually getting it to work. 

● Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
- I would say yes, the app secures the password of the user and their personal information. 

Like, email, age, password and once they log in their information is stored in a secured
database. 
● What functionality will your app include?
- It includes a login, registration, logout, profile, and track component that would 
help users navigate to different options in the app.

● What will the user flow look like?
- First, they need to sign up with email, password, and age. After they are logged in, they
would be able to login with their email and password. The age is necessary to know the age of the 
user and if they are younger than 12, then it won't let them to sign in.

● What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch
goals?
- My stretch goal in this application is for the users necessities to be met. I want the
users to be able to use this application throughout their day and make it easy for them
 to navigate and store their information. Also, avoiding interrumptions as much as possble,
like crashing or slowing down. This application should be easy and simple to use.
